A feather and a hammer dropped on the Moon (where there's no atmosphere) hit the ground simultaneously—as dramatically demonstrated by Apollo 15 astronaut David Scott in 1971.",

Everest's summit, $g \\approx 9.77 m/s^2$. (2) **Latitude**: Earth's rotation creates a centrifugal effect that's strongest at the equator, reducing effective gravity there to $g \\approx 9.78 m/s^2$ versus $g \\approx 9.83 m/s^2$ at the poles.
