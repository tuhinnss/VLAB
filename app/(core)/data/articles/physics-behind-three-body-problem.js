Instead of plotting a body's position vs time, you plot its state — position AND velocity simultaneously — as a single point in a multidimensional space. As the system evolves, this point traces a trajectory. For integrable (fully solvable) systems, these trajectories lie on smooth, nested surfaces called **KAM tori** (after Kolmogorov, Arnold, and Moser). For chaotic systems, the trajectories fill a 'fuzzy' region called a **strange attractor** — never quite repeating, tracing fractal patterns of infinite complexity. Poincaré Sections are cross-sections through this space, taken once per orbital period — like a strobe light on a complex dance. Regular motion produces dots on neat curves. Chaotic motion produces a fog of scattered points with fractal structure.",

            content:
              "The term 'butterfly effect' was coined by meteorologist Edward Lorenz in 1972, based on his 1963 discovery that a simple model of atmospheric convection (three coupled differential equations now called the Lorenz system) was exquisitely sensitive to initial conditions. He found that two nearly identical weather simulations diverged completely within a few weeks. But the butterfly effect has precise limits. (1) It does NOT mean small causes always have large effects — most perturbations in most systems decay, not amplify. (2) It DOES mean that in chaotic systems, there exists a timescale (the Lyapunov time $1/\\lambda$) beyond which prediction is impossible with finite precision instruments. For weather, this is about 1–2 weeks. For Mercury's orbit, it is about 5 million years. For a double pendulum, it is about 1 second. (3) The butterfly effect is a property of the mathematical equations, not a mystical principle. If you could measure initial conditions to infinite precision, you could predict arbitrarily far into the future — but infinite precision measurement is physically impossible.",

The physics inspiration is the dimensionality reduction in string theory. The books also deal with the 'Lightspeed Ship' (relativistic travel causing time dilation), the 'Wallfacer' strategy (a game-theoretic shield against a civilisation that can read minds), and an ending that operates on scales of billions of years and encompasses the ultimate fate of the universe.

When three bodies interact in a close encounter, they typically go through a chaotic 'scrambling' phase and then split apart — with one body ejected and the other two bound together. The probability distribution of outcomes — which body gets ejected, with what energy — can be computed using a **statistical mechanics** approach that treats the chaotic intermediate phase as if it were thermal equilibrium.

More recently, machine learning models have been used to identify patterns in three-body scattering statistics and to accelerate the search for new periodic orbit families. But AI does not 'solve' the three-body problem in any fundamental sense — it approximates solutions, sometimes very well. The underlying truth remains: for chaotic trajectories, no algorithm (neural or otherwise) can predict exact positions beyond the Lyapunov time without knowing initial conditions to arbitrary precision. What AI can do is make us vastly more efficient at exploring the rich landscape of three-body dynamics — an exciting and accelerating collaboration between human mathematical insight and machine computational power.",
