In physics, many candidates compete for 'most beautiful equation': Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism (four equations that unified electricity, magnetism, and light), Dirac's equation (which predicted antimatter before it was discovered), or the Schrödinger equation ($i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = \\hat{H}\\Psi$) which governs quantum systems.

Reading and watching videos builds familiarity; solving problems builds understanding. When you get stuck (and you will), that struggle is the learning happening. Work through it before looking at the solution. The confusion, and the moment of clarity that follows, is what learning physics feels like from the inside.",

Particle accelerators are probing matter at energies never before achieved. And on the theoretical frontier, physicists are grappling with questions about the nature of space, time, and information that may require entirely new conceptual frameworks — as radical as quantum mechanics was in 1927.",

It spans scales from quarks to the cosmos, grounds all other natural sciences, and has produced every major technology of the modern world. Its methods combine experiment and theory in a rigorous self-correcting loop. Its unanswered questions — dark matter, quantum gravity, the nature of time — are among the most profound ever posed. And it is open to everyone willing to think carefully and curiously about the world they inhabit.",
