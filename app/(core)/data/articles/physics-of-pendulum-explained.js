Now imagine two bobs of different masses on identical strings. Surprisingly, they swing at the same rate! Mass doesn't matter for a simple pendulum's period. Finally, if you take your pendulum to the Moon (where gravity is weaker), it would swing more slowly. These intuitions lead to the period relationship: **longer string means slower swings, stronger gravity means faster swings, mass is irrelevant**.",
